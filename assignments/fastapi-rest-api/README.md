# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to design, implement, and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. Students will build a simple API, understand routing, request/response models, and basic error handling.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Task 1: Set Up FastAPI Project

#### Description
Initialize a new FastAPI project and create a basic API endpoint.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Create a main application file (e.g., `main.py`)
- Implement a root endpoint (`/`) that returns a welcome message


### 🛠️	Task 2: Create CRUD Endpoints

#### Description
Design and implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for a simple resource (e.g., `items`).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Define a Pydantic model for the resource
- Implement endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting items
- Handle basic error cases (e.g., item not found)


### 🛠️ Task 3: Test Your API

#### Description
Test your API using HTTP requests (with curl, httpie, or a tool like Postman).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Demonstrate example requests and responses for each endpoint in a `README.md` section
- Include at least one example for each CRUD operation
- Document how to run the server and test endpoints
